# Programs in c++

In this repository there are a series of programs in c++ language, which I use to learn this language and I hope they serve you.
Compiling programs in languaje c++ **`g++ executable -o program.cpp`** and run **`./executable`**, example:

![App Screenshot](https://github.com/shapzo/Programs-in-c/blob/main/Screenshot/Program%20in%20c++.png?raw=true)

```bash
    g++ -o 1 1¬∞\ program.cpp
```
and to run them from the terminal emulator is with:
```bash
    ./1
```

## Programs you can run on Windows as well as Linux

- Program 1: Printing of numbers
- Program 2: Program that calculates the average of 3 grades
- Program 3: Calculate the square and cube of a number
- Program 4: Compare 2 numbers, if they are greater than or equal
- Program 5: Compare 3 numbers, if they are greater than or equal
- Program 6: Increase 8% of a worker's salary
- Program 7: A worker's salary is deducted from 3 or 9 percent of his salary depending on how much he earns
- Program 8: Program that converts temperatures (for windows)
- Program 9: Calculate the square and cube of 2 numbers

**programs with functions**

- Program 10: Program that calculates the square the cube and the root of a number with functions
- Program 11: Program that calculates basic operations with functions

**programs with pointers**

In these programs it is about accommodating the numbers to a desired figure.

- Program 12: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (3, 7, 4, 17, 93)
- Program 13: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (5, 15, 18, 20, 24, 42, 46, 50, 98, 100)
- Program 14: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 70, 90)
- Program 15: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (18, 100, 42, 50, 5, 20, 42)
- Program 16: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (30, 1, 5, 5, 8, 17, 6, 40, 0, 10, 26, 40, 9)

**In these programs it is about accommodating the letters to a desired word**

- Program 17: Order the letters to print the word on the screen: popocatepetl üåã
- Program 18: Order the letters to print the word on the screen: Estacionamiento 
- Program 19: Order the letters to print the word on the screen: Desoxirribonucleico
- Program 20: Order the letters to print the word on the screen: Programacion avanzada

**Area and function calculation programs**

- Program 21: Program for trigonometric functions, sine, cosine and tangent.
- Program 22: Program that calculates the area of a circle, trapezoid and ellipse.
- Program 23: Program that calculates the volumes of geometric figures.
- Program 24: Area and perimeter of the triangle, equation.
- Program 25: Calculates the sine cosine and tangent.
- Program 26: Create character triangles.

Sort method programs

- Program 27: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Program 28: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 30)
- Program 29: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (1, 2, 4, 11, 15, 18, 21, 30, 39, 42, 44, 55, 98)
- Program 30: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (7, 8, 10, 10, 11, 21, 22, 31, 32, 33, 42, 44, 52, 58)
- Program 31: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 11, 15, 21, 21, 22, 30, 30, 35)
- Program 32: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (100, 105, 120, 176, 182, 187, 201, 221, 222, 254, 258, 321, 326, 456, 478, 540, 654, 772, 789, 852)
- Program 33: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (10, 45, 50, 62, 84)
- Program 34: Sort the numbers to print the figure on the screen: (1, 4, 12, 18, 23, 39, 45, 74)

## For windows environments

Programs that run in windows environments.

If you have problems in windows add the following libraries to the programs:
```bash
    include <conio.h>
    include <windows.h>
```
also in pointer programs, uncomment some of the lines so you can better see how the programs work, for example:

```bash 
    uncomment if you are in windows, so that the cmd or powershell console changes color XD
    system("color 3b");
```
