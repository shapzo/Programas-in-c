# Programas in c

It is a repository with some programs in c language
to compile the programs is like this **`gcc -o executable program.c`**, but for programs with functions from the **math.h** library, they must be linked, so the command would be as follows: **`gcc program.c -o execuatble -lm`**

## Programs

- Program 1: Program of addition, subtraction and module of memory vectors.

This program its operation consists of working with memory vectors, the operations it performs are: addition and subtraction as well as the module; the output of the operations is saved in **.txt** files.

- Program 2: Dynamic memory program.

This program is about storing numbers in memory.

- Program 3: Program that calculates functions.
- Program 4: Program that calculates the radians and degrees of a number.
- Program 5: Program that opens a file, and calculates the cos sine and adds the output to a new file.

For this program, you must first have a **txt** file and in it you must have numbers with a range from -30 to 30; already after the execution is finished, the program will create an output file with the results.
